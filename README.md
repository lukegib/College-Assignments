## Year 1

### Programming 1

This class was an introduction to programming using the **C** language. Through completion of the assignments, I learned about data types, arrays, pointers, functions, file handling, etc.

### Next-Gen Technologies

This class provided an introduction into web development and included the use of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **AJAX** to complete the assignments.

## Year 2

### Database Systems

This class discussed the main concepts of database systems and allowed me to gain experience with **SQL** as I had to carry out relational database operations.

### OOP

This class included an introduction into Object-Oriented Programming which was carried out using **Java**. I learned the basics of OOP as well as common data structures and algorithms (stacks, queues, tree structures, etc.)

### Software Engineering 1

I completed two projects in this class:

#### 1. Football Teams Web Page

This assignment required creating an SPA using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. It also needed to contain an area in which users could leave comments.

#### 2. Climate - A Client to Client Web App

This project was completed in partnership with another student, Andrew Dawod, and had the idea of allowing users to communicate (text, video, and file transfer) via client to client connections using WebRTC.

My role in the team was to design and implement the applications frontend (using **JavaScript** (handlebars.js), **Bootstrap**, **HTML** and **CSS**). Unfortunately, the project ended up being too large scale and is largely incomplete, however, a prototype can be viewed in the demo folder.


## Year 3

### Internship Report

This is the report that I had to submit upon completion of my internship. It contains many of the projects I completed (primarily using the JS framework **Vue.js** and **PHP**) during the 8 months as well as what I learned from the experience.

  
## Year 4

### Software Engineering 3

This contains an assignment in which a registration system for a school is built (part 1) which is then used in a second repository that acts as a driver for the system, creating students and assigning them modules/courses (part 2). It was required to have a continuous integration pipeline and involved using **Java**, **Maven**, **GitHub**, and **Shippable** to complete.

### Machine Learning

There is a couple of assignments in this module. The first is on classification, using two algorithms to complete the task of determining beer labels and then comparing the two. The second takes the same approach except it is a regression task with the job being to predict beer ratings. Both assignments were completed in **Python** and use the **Scikit-Learn** library.
